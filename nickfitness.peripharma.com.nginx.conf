    #Next, we can tell Nginx not to worry if it can't find a favicon. We will also point it to the location of our
    #static files directory where we collected our site's static elements:
    location = /favicon.ico {
        access_log off;
        log_not_found off;
    }

    #Next we can create a catch-all location block that will pass all additional queries straight to our application. We
    #will include the uwsgi parameters found in the /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params and pass the traffic to the socket that the
    #uWSGI server sets up:
    location / {
         include uwsgi_params;
         uwsgi_pass unix:/run/uwsgi/nickfitness_project.sock;
